- Docker + Docker Compose
- Nginx web server
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
1.3 Backend Setup
 Install Laravel 10+
 Set up JWT authentication
 Configure database connection
 Create base API response structure
 Set up CORS and security middleware
1.4 Docker Environment
 Create docker-compose.yml with services:
Frontend (Nginx)
Backend (PHP-FPM + Nginx)
MySQL/PostgreSQL
Redis (for caching)
 Configure networking and volumes
 Set up development environment with hot-reloading
Phase 2: Backend Development (Weeks 2-3)
2.1 Authentication Module
 Implement JWT authentication with tymon/jwt-auth
 Create AuthController with endpoints:
POST /api/register
POST /api/login
POST /api/logout
GET /api/user
 Implement refresh token mechanism
 Create authentication middleware
2.2 Form Management
 Create database migrations:
php
// forms
- id
- user_id (foreign)
- title
- description
- created_at
- updated_at

// form_structures
- id
- form_id (foreign)
- structure (JSON)
- created_at
- updated_at
2.3 API Endpoints
 FormController with CRUD operations:
GET /api/forms - List forms
POST /api/forms - Create form
GET /api/forms/{id} - Get form
PUT /api/forms/{id} - Update form
DELETE /api/forms/{id} - Delete form
2.4 Validation & Error Handling
 Create form request validators
 Implement JSON structure validation
 Set up global exception handler
 Create API resource responses
Phase 3: Frontend Development (Weeks 4-6)
3.1 Authentication Flow
 Create Auth pages:
Login form
Registration form
Protected route wrapper
 Implement auth context and hooks
 Set up axios interceptors for JWT
3.2 Form Builder Core
 Create DnD context and providers
 Implement form state management:
typescript
interface FormState {
  sections: Array<{
    id: string;
    title: string;
    groups: Array<{
      id: string;
      title: string;
      fields: FormField[];
    }>;
  }>;
}
